# CV

My personal CV template.
`latex`

# How to use

See **example.pdf** to preview what the CV will look like.

The CV is broken up into different sections defined in **main.tex**.
You probably won't need to edit this file unless you want to change the design.

Edit the sections how you see fit.

To compile, run `pdflatex main.tex`.

However, every time a new .svg is added (including the first time you compile), it needs to be converted.
To do so compile with `pdflatex --shell-escape main.tex`.

Your final result will appear as **main.pdf**.

# Can I use this template for...?

Yes.
